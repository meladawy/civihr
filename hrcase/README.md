**HR Case**

[Task & Assignments (uk.co.compucorp.civicrm.tasksassignments)] is a standalone extension for 
managing Tasks & Assignments , but for HR use (CiviHR specifically) it would be easier to have some 
default data already set up and this is what this extension does. This default data includes :

1- Assignments (Case) Types. ( specifically **Joining** & **Exiting** Assignments types ).
2- Activity Types ( Created a long with Assignments types ).
3- Relationship Types. (**HR Manager**, **Line Manager** & **Recruiting Manager**)
